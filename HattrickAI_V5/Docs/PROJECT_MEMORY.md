# Hattrick AI V5 Project Memory

## Purpose

This file is the permanent project memory for important architectural decisions, implementation notes, and investigation results.

The goal is to prevent loss of context during future development.

# Development Rules

Before changing any engine:

1. Locate the real calculation source in code.
2. Identify input and output models.
3. Document the change in CHANGE_HISTORY.md.
4. Update ENGINE_MAP.md if motor relationships change.
5. Run related acceptance tests.

Never document a calculation that is not confirmed from code, config, tests, or official reference documents.

# Stage 9 — Motor Output JSON Database

## Verified milestone — 2026-09-06

The Motor DB archive now stores the real web analysis `Analysis`, `MotorPipelineResult`, candidate DB data and `MotorRunLog` telemetry through `MotorResultArchive`.

The JSON archive contract is `hattrickai-v5-motor-database-v1`. Each save produces a run-specific JSON file and updates `latest.json`.

C19 acceptance verifies the archive writer/schema and latest/list/run lookup behavior.

C20 acceptance verifies deterministic JSON payload representation across repeated writes. Only the naturally varying `savedAt` and `runId` metadata are excluded from the payload comparison. The test also verifies stable build and schema-version fields and confirms that `savedAt` remains per-write metadata.

Important boundary: Stage 9 stores existing production output. It does not add a new motor calculation, tactical selector, or decision rule.

# Verified Investigation Results

## Tactical Display / Tactical Selection

Goal:

Show the real calculated match tactic in the Recommended XI card, if the production pipeline actually calculates one.

### Verified production behavior — 2026-09-05

The current web analysis path does **not** contain a tactical-selector stage that chooses between tactics such as AttackMiddle or AttackWings.

`HattrickAI_V5/Core/AnalysisService.cs` creates the rating context with:

`new RatingContext(locationEnum, questionnaire.MatchImportance, TeamTactic.Normal)`

Therefore the production analysis pipeline currently enters the motor pipeline with `TeamTactic.Normal`.

`HattrickAI_V5/Core/MotorPipelineService.cs` passes the tactic from `context.RatingContext.Tactic` into `MatchState`. The tactic is then consumed by M7/M7.2/M8 calculations.

`HattrickAI_V5/Core/AdvancedTacticalScenarioEngine.cs` maps the supplied team tactic to `AdvancedTactic`, calculates tactic skill and tactical effects, and returns the resulting scenario. It does **not** choose the team tactic.

`HattrickAI_V5/Core/M8ChanceAllocationEngine.cs` also consumes the supplied tactic to calculate tactic conversion and chance distribution. It does **not** select the tactic.

`HattrickAI_V5/Core/M10FinalDecisionEngine.cs` selects the final formation/plan and match attitude. Its `SelectApproach` logic is about `TeamAttitude` (Normal / PlayItCool / MatchOfTheSeason), not `TeamTactic`.

### Important conclusion

It would be incorrect for the frontend to display `ORTADAN ATAK`, `KANATTAN ATAK`, etc. as a calculated tactic based on the current production analysis path.

For the current web path, the truthful state is:

- Tactical selector: **not implemented / not present in production analysis path**
- Supplied team tactic: **TeamTactic.Normal**
- UI semantic value when no tactical decision exists: **TAKTİK YOK**

Do not hardcode a tactical strategy merely to make the UI look complete.

### Related implementation files

- `HattrickAI_V5/Core/AnalysisService.cs` — creates `RatingContext` with `TeamTactic.Normal`.
- `HattrickAI_V5/Core/MotorPipelineService.cs` — carries the tactic into `MatchState` and downstream motor calculations.
- `HattrickAI_V5/Core/AdvancedTacticalScenarioEngine.cs` — calculates effects of the supplied tactic; does not select it.
- `HattrickAI_V5/Core/M8ChanceAllocationEngine.cs` — calculates chance/tactic conversion effects; does not select the tactic.
- `HattrickAI_V5/Core/M10FinalDecisionEngine.cs` — selects final plan/attitude, not team tactic.

### Documentation rule

Any future UI or manual text claiming that V5 "calculates the best tactic" must first be backed by an actual selector/calculation path in code. Until such a path exists, document the tactic as supplied input (`Normal`) rather than as an engine decision.

# Stage 5 — Real Match Example — 2026-09-05

The real CHPP fixture `TestJSON/HattrickAI_V5_CHPP_FullOffline_2026-09-01.json` was reviewed and documented in `HattrickAI_V5/Docs/REAL_MATCH_ANALYSIS.md`.

Fixture SHA: `540a63d381defbf49d4d89553370b90114bf4815`.

The example separates:

- the future match `769648177` (Zeytinburnu Sahil Spor vs S4MSUNFC),
- the opponent's historical reference match `769648173` (bombacı mülayim spor 3-2 Zeytinburnu Sahil Spor),
- normalized player data,
- M3 player-analysis output,
- M4/M5 generated XI,
- M7 regional ratings,
- opponent threat/opportunity output.

The fixture's stored `v5Analysis` does not expose complete standalone M8/M9/M10/M6-B/DB2/M11 final-result objects. Those values are therefore not reconstructed or invented in the Stage 5 documentation.

Verified future-match XI from the fixture:

Verified V5 regional ratings:

```text

LA 10.25 / CA 11.50 / RA 9.25

Zeytinburnu Sahil Spor
LD 6.25 / CD 9.50 / RD 6.25 / MID 7.00
LA 10.00 / CA 13.00 / RA 8.50
DEF 22.00 / ATT 31.50
```

This example is reference data for the technical manual, not a claim that the historical match result is a V5 prediction.

# Known Acceptance / Documentation Risks

- Acceptance/regression behavior has changed during recent C10-C18 fixes; do not describe C10-C18 as universally green unless the corresponding run has actually been verified.
- C13 previously compared exposed DB2 count against production SecondPass count incorrectly. The production pipeline exposes a formation-diversified DB2 subset, so exposed count and production DB2 count are not required to be equal.
- C17 contains pipeline/telemetry continuity checks, but a successful `Finish` event must be verified before documenting the acceptance as fully passing.
- C18 deterministic rerun regression exists and is invoked after C17; its current pass status must be verified from an actual run before documenting it as green.

# Current Documentation Project

The technical manual is being built incrementally from repository code, tests, configuration and reference documents.

The manual must distinguish clearly between:

1. formulas/reference material from source documents,
2. actual V5 implementation,
3. test/acceptance behavior,
4. unresolved or missing implementation.

No guessed calculation, coefficient, selector or UI behavior may be presented as an implemented feature.
